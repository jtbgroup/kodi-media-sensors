This Home Assistant component is used to feed custom cards like [Upcoming Media Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card), [Kodi Playlist Card](https://github.com/jtbgroup/kodi-playlist-card) or [Kodi Search Card](https://github.com/jtbgroup/kodi-search-card) with data coming from Kodi. It is based on the project of Aaron Godfrey (https://github.com/boralyl/kodi-recently-added). Check the [credits section](#credits).

## Installation

### Pre-Installation

**NOTE: This component has been tested with the (almost) last versions of Home Assistant. No backward compatibility is tested.Additionally Kodi must be setup via the UI in the integrations section of the Home Assistant configuration.**

### HACS Install

1. Search for `Kodi Media Sensors` under `Integrations` in the HACS Store tab.
2. **You will need to restart after installation for the component to start working.**
3. Go to [Integration Installation](#integration_installation) your sensor using the options.

### Manual Install

**This method is not recommended**

1. In your `/config` directory, create a `custom_components` folder if one does not exist.
2. Copy the [kodi_media_sensors](https://github.com/jtbgroup/kodi-media-sensors/tree/master/custom_components) folder and all of it's contents from to your `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to [Integration Installation](#integration-installation) your sensor using the options.

### Integration Installation

1. After Automatic install or manual install, go to the Integration panel (under Configuration section) and search for the ne component by clicking on the button 'Add Integration'. Enter the name of the component (Kodi Media Sensors).
2. During the installation, choose the Kodi entity previously installed.
3. Select the sensors you want to use (see [Available Sensors](#available-sensors))
4. Click Submit
5. You should now see new entities in Home Assistant (one for each sensor activated)

It's not possible to add new sensors after installation, so if you need new ones (or if you don't need one anymore), just uninstall the integration and add it again. You will then be able to select the sensors you need.

## Sensors

| Sensor name | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `sensor.kodi_media_sensor_recently_added_tvshow` | The sensor is contains information about the recently added tvshows in Kodi. The sensor updated by polling kodi on a regular base. |
| `sensor.kodi_media_sensor_recently_added_movie` | The sensor is contains information about the recently added movies in Kodi. The sensor updated by polling kodi on a regular base. |
| `sensor.kodi_media_sensor_playlist` | The sensor is contains information about the running playlist (audio and video) in Kodi. The sensor is updated using the events generated by the Kodi integration. |
| `sensor.kodi_media_sensor_search` | The sensor allows you to search for media content in the kodi libraries. The sensor has multiple configuration options so you can choose the media type you want to include in your search result. <br/> After calling this method, metadata are also filled in depending on what has been called. So a normal Search or a Rcently Added search will add the method and arguments to the metadata. A Clear willremove the method and arguments from the metadata. Play and Reset Addons will have no effect and will keep the previous result.|

Some sensors come with services you can use. The definition of the services depends on each sensor. The service can be called via ***call_method***


## Configuration

### Configuring the Integrations

A `Configure` button will appear on the integration. Clicking this will allow you to
toggle additional options. To access the option, the right sensor must be present.

| Option | Sensor | Default | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ---- |
| hide_watched | recently added movie, <br/>recently added tvshow | false | Excludes recently added video media that is marked as watched (movie sensors) when option is schecked |
| search_songs | search | false | Include SONGS search result |
| search_songs_limit | search | 15 | Limits the number of SONGS in the search result. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited) or a positive integer. |
| search_albums | search | true | Include ALBUMS search result |
| search_albums_limit | search | 10 | Limits the number of ALBUMS in the search result. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited) or a positive integer. |
| search_artists | search | true | Include ARTISTS search result |
| search_artists_limit | search | 10 | Limits the number of ARTISTS in the search result. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited) or a positive integer.|
| search_movies | search | true | Include MOVIES search result |
| search_movies_limit | search | 5 | Limits the number of MOVIES in the search result. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited) or a positive integer.|
| search_musicvideos | search | true | Include MUSIC VIDEOS search result. The search is performed on two fileds: title of the song or the artist name. The result is a mix of both subqueries.  |
| search_musicvideos_limit | search | 5 | Limits the number of MUSIC VIDEOS in the search result. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited) or a positive integer.|
| search_tvshows | search | true | Include TVSHOWS search result |
| search_tvshows_limit | search | 5 | Limits the number of TVSHOWS in the search result. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited) or a positive integer. |
| search_episodes | search | true | Include EPISODES search result |
| search_episodes_limit | search | 5 | Limits the number of EPISODES in the search result. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited) or a positive integer. |
| search_channels_tv | search | true | Include TV CHANNELS search result |
| search_channels_tv_limit | search | 10 | Limits the number of TV CHANNELS in the search result. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited) or a positive integer.|
| search_channels_radio | search | true | Include RADIO CHANNELS search result |
| search_channels_radio_limit | search | 5 | Limits the number of RADIO CHANNELS in the search result. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited) or a positive integer. |
| search_recently_added_songs | search | true | Include SONGS search result in RECENTLY ADDED items |
| search_recently_added_albums | search | true | Include ALBUMS search result in RECENTLY ADDED items |
| search_recently_added_movies | search | true | Include MOVIES search result in RECENTLY ADDED items |
| search_recently_added_musicvideos | search | true | Include MUSIC VIDEOS search result in RECENTLY ADDED items |
| search_recently_added_episodes | search | true | Include EPISODES search result in RECENTLY ADDED items |
| search_recently_added_limit | search | 20 | Limits the number of result when searching the RECENTLY ADDED items. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited **>>> bad idea**) or a positive integer. |
| search_recently_played_songs | search | true | Include SONGS search result in RECENTLY PLAYED items |
| search_recently_played_albums | search | true | Include ALBUMS search result in RECENTLY PLAYED items |
| search_recently_played_limit | search | 10 | Limits the number of result when searching the RECENTLY PLAYED items. <br/>Value must be O (unlimited **>>> bad idea**) or a positive integer. |
| search_keep_alive_timer | search | 300 | Lifetime (in sec) of the result. <br/>When using value **0**, the query will automatially be reprocessed with the same parameters. This is only true for search methods (_normal search_ and _recently added_), not the other methods (like _clear_ or _reset addons_). <br/> **Remark**: the timer also depends on the polling of the sensor which is set to 300 sec. The evaluation of purging data is only evaluated during the polling. This means the real lifetime of the data is between the specified value and this value added by the polling eriod. <br/> Ex: if value = 20 sec, the purge occurs after a period between 20sec and 320sec |

## Services

### Sensor **Playlist**

1. ***goto(posn, player)***

    This function plays the object at the given position for the given player

    Example:

    ``` yaml
        entity_id: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_playlist
        method: goto
        item: 
          playerid: 0
          to: 5
    ```

2. ***remove(posn, player)***

    This function removes an object from the given playlist 

    Example:

    ``` yaml
        entity_id: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_playlist
        method: remove
        item:
          playlistid: 0
          position: 5
    ```

### Sensor **Search**

1. ***search(media_type, value)***

    Searches in the specified media type for the referenced value. The media type 'all' will return result for songs, albums, artists, movies and tv shows.
    - `media_type:` { all &#124; artist &#124; tvshow &#124; recently_added &#124; recently_played}
    - `value:` { str (title) &#124; int (artistid) &#124; int (tvshowid) }

    Example:

    ``` yaml
        entity_id: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_search
        method: search
        item:
          media_type: all
          value: beatles
    ```

    ``` yaml
        entity_id: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_search
        method: search
        item:
          media_type: recently_played
    ```

2. ***clear()***

    This function clears the data of the sensor

    Example:

    ``` yaml
        entity_id: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_search
        method: clear
    ```

3. ***play(arg)***

    This function plays the desired object wth the good player. The argument depends on what object has to be played. The argument can be one of `songid`, `albumid`, `movieid`, `episodeid` or `channelid`.

    Examples:

    ``` yaml
        entity_id: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_search
        method: play
        songid: 1
    ```

    ``` yaml
        entity_id: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_search
        method: play
        movieid: 15
    ```

4.  ***add(arg)***
    This method adds an item to the right playlist depending on the item passed. The argument can be one of `songid`, `albumid`, `movieid`, `episodeid` or `channelid`. The `position`argument indicates where the item must be added in the playlist. The playlist index is 0-based, so 0 is the first position. To add an item at the end of the playlist, just use a index > the length of the playlist (ex: use 1000 when you have a playlist of 50 items, even in party mode).

    Example: 

     ``` yaml
        entity_id: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_search
        method: add
        songid: 1
        position: 10
    ```

5. ***reset_addons()***

    This method resets the presence (and active status) of the addons. This is to call for example if you activate a PVR client addon and you want to include the search results of the channels in your resultset.
    ... another option would be to reboot HA!

    Example:

    ``` yaml
        service: kodi_media_sensors.call_method
        data:
          entity_id: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_search
          method: reset_addons
    ```

### Cards to use with sensors

The goal is to group all the sensors and have seperate Cards to display the sensors data. The cards that where tested are:

- [Upcoming Media Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card) (kodi_media_sensor_recently_added_tvshow or kodi_media_sensor_recently_added_movie)
- [Kodi Playlist Card](https://github.com/jtbgroup/kodi-playlist-card) (kodi_media_sensor_playlist)
- [Kodi Search Card](https://github.com/jtbgroup/kodi-search-card) (kodi_media_sensor_search)

**Samples** for ui-lovelace.yaml

Depending on the sensors you added and the custom card you installed, you can use the code below to display information from Kodi.

Here two examples with [Upcoming Media Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card) and [Kodi Playlist Card](https://github.com/jtbgroup/kodi-playlist-card)

  ``` yaml
    - type: custom:upcoming-media-card
      entity: sensor.kodi_recently_added_tv
      title: Recently Added Episodes
      image_style: fanart
   ```

  ``` yaml
    - type: custom:kodi-playlist-card
      entity: sensor.kodi_media_sensor_playlist
   ```

## Upgrading from configuration.yaml to UI Integration

1. Remove any sensors in your `configuration.yaml` that reference the `kodi_media_sensors`
   platform.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Follow the steps from the begining in the section [Installation](#installation)

## Known Issues

Below is a list of known issues that either can't be fixed by changes to the component
itself due to external factors.

### Artwork does not load

One reason this could occur is if you setup you Home Assistance instance to use SSL and
your Kodi instance does not use SSL. When the upcoming-media-card tries to load the
artwork it will fail to do so since modern browsers do not allow loading insecure requests.
See [#6](https://github.com/boralyl/kodi-recently-added/issues/6) for more details and
possible workarounds.

### Genres, ratings and studios don't show up for TV Shows

Currently genres, rating, and studio are only populated for Movies. This is a limitation
of the data Kodi stores for TV shows.

## Credits

[Aaron Godfrey](https://github.com/boralyl) is the original developer of this project and did an excellent job. As I needed something similar to display my running playlist in Kodi, I started to enhance the component.
Thanks a lot Aaron for letting me enhance your project! Let's hope other people might find it useful.
Do not hesitate to support Aaron and his many projects.

Also thanks to all the people for testing, reporting dysfunctions and propose improvements.
